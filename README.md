# web-automation
The Web Automation Project leverages Selenium, a powerful web automation framework, to interact with the Chrome browser programmatically. This project automates various tasks such as navigating to specific websites, typing inputs into form fields, and simulating user actions like clicking buttons. Using Selenium WebDriver, the automation interacts directly with the Chrome browser by controlling and simulating keyboard and mouse actions, mimicking a real user's behavior.

The automation script allows for efficient browser navigation, handling complex workflows such as automatic form submission, website login, and data extraction. By writing reusable Selenium scripts, the project automates the entire process, from opening the Chrome browser to interacting with elements on the webpage, like buttons, text fields, and dropdown menus, using XPath or CSS selectors to locate and interact with the DOM (Document Object Model).

Additionally, this project includes an automation script for the Cookie Clicker game, automating clicks to progress through levels in the game. The script continuously clicks the cookie in the game at high speed, advancing the game by unlocking upgrades and higher levels without manual intervention. By automating the repetitive clicking tasks, the script efficiently handles the game progression, leading to faster and more optimized gameplay.

The entire automation process is customizable, allowing users to fine-tune the intervals and actions taken during the automation, while handling browser cookies, sessions, and interactions seamlessly. This project demonstrates the efficiency of web automation in both real-world scenarios, such as form submissions, and interactive web applications like games.
